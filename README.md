# Reactor Demo App

Demo isomorphic app using [reactor-core](https://github.com/natew/reactor-core) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Shows how reactor-core helps simplify putting together the core pieces (async components, pages, routing, pushState). Adds in webpack, bower, and a simple api server to demo some of reacts abilities.

## Installation

    npm run first-run

And start it:

    npm start

And head to [localhost:3111](localhost:3111).

If you get an error regarding EMFILE, this is because browserify is trying to watch too many files for your OS. This is a temporary fix:

    ulimit -n 10000; npm start

## What it does

- Renders app from server, continues app on client
- Routing, Async Page components, pushState
- Super simple API demo
- Cortex to handle data
- Webpack to manage assets

## Todo

- Expore moving to immutable-object
- State handler to post back to API
- Better example components
- 500 pages
- Link component
- Testing
- Forms
- ...
